# kenv - Kris' ENVironment

As an engineer I do a lot of very delicate things. I am also super lazy. Here is a place where I store commonly used tools for developing.

Feel free to use these, or change them, or just borrow the framework/patterns.

Cheers

Kris

# Install

The install script will append a line to ~/.bash_profile this will need to be sourced in order for kenv to run correctly.

    sh install.sh && source ~/.bash_profile

# Emacs

Yes.. I **absolutely** use [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). So here you can find my .emacs.

Seriously.. I love emacs..
